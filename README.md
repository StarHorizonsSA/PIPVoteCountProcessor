# PIPVoteCountProcessor
This program processes JSON files of Star Atlas PIP voting records. The user selects a file, and the program extracts, normalizes, and aggregates the voting data, then displays the results in the terminal, including the vote counts and voting power for YES, NO, and ABSTAIN, with timestamps in UTC.
